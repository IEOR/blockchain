## Course description
The Blockchain Challenge Lab course aims to bridge the gaps between industry and academia as well as hype and reality when it comes to Blockchain technology. This is an entrepreneurial and very applied course, where we will explain how the transformative Blockchain technology works, how to actually apply it to solve problems, and we will present a rational view of this often over-hyped technology. 

The students will work in groups on a Blockchain related challenge over the semester, and in the end this project could be turned into a new venture or a contribution to research.

Students will learn proven entrepreneurial methods and apply user-centered design tools in creating their company. Guest lectures from industry and academia, as well as hands-on group exercises and presentation of use cases will help along the way. A competition among the groups will decide a winning team that gets to compete in the SCET Collider Cup at the end of the Fall semester 2018.
